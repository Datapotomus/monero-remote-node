# monero-remote-node

I really liked what [kannix/monero-full-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/kannix/monero-full-node/~/dockerfile/) did with his monero node, but I wanted to make it smaller in the name of making everything more portable. So, my image is based off Alpine Linux. 
There isn't much difference between a full node, and a remote node. Execpt you can use your GUI wallet to connect to it, and keep a copy of the blockchain off of your computer.
